# Programming Marathon Roadmap

This repository contains a study plan focused on programming marathons and algorithm competitions.

The roadmap is **based on a guide originally created at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)** and was adapted for personal study and self-paced learning.

It presents a step-by-step progression through key algorithmic topics, with curated exercises from popular online judges.

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Covers

- Algorithmic problem-solving strategies
- Common techniques used in competitions
- A structured routine of study and practice
- A gradual path from basic to advanced topics

## ðŸ§© Organization

The roadmap is divided into levels and topics. Each level includes areas such as:

- Basic programming and logic  
- Greedy algorithms and binary search  
- Recursion and backtracking  
- Dynamic programming  
- Data structures  
- Graphs and number theory  
- Advanced techniques and optimizations  

Exercises are selected from platforms like:

- Codeforces  
- Beecrowd/URI  
- CSES  
- SPOJ  

## ðŸ§  Scope

This roadmap is suitable for training for contests like ICPC, OBI, and other algorithm-focused competitions.
